- ***Init*** and ***End*** describe the relationships between a CSP# parent process and some (but not all) of its child processes, where a parent (child) process is a CSP# process represented by a parent (child) node in the syntax tree. ***Init***[*P*]=*C*[] means that if process *P* begins, then it will begin the processes in *C*[]. And ***End***[*C*]=*P* means that if process *C* ends its execution, then it will tell *P* to end its execution.
- ***Next*** describes the sequential logic between the CSP# processes within a participant. ***Next***[*A*]=*B*[] means that if process *A* ends its execution, then processes in *B*[] can start its execution.
- ***And*** describes the relationship among the CSP# processes in a parallel gateway. ***And***[*A*]=*B*[] means that process *A* and processes in *B*[] can be executed in parallel, and only when all of them completes, the task after the parallel gateway can start.
-  ***Xor*** describes the relationship among the CSP# processes in an exclusive gateway. ***Xor***[*A*]=*B*[] means that if process *A* starts its execution, then all the processes in *B*[] can not start any more.
-  ***Enable*** describes the relationship related to message interactions. If *A* is a CSP# process to send a message, and *B* is a CSP# process to receive the message, then ***Enable***[*A*]=*B*. It means that only when a message has be sent, it can be received.
